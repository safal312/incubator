# The Incubator

In ancient times, big bird-like creatures used to inhabit the planet Ova. A million years ago, a pandemic of sorts caused the extinction of the birds. That led to an imbalance in the planet’s ecosystem. However, in the following years, the parasite managed to infuse with the eggs of the birds. This led the eggs to gain consciousness. After many years, the eggs managed to establish a society and live harmoniously in it. 

However, there are some eggs who believe that the true nature of the world is to go back to where it started. They are on a mission to bring back the giant birds. After having people try to bring back the birds, the supreme court decided to make use of incubators and the formation of related cults illegal.

This particular scene takes place inside a makeshift Incubator where a group of eggs from the cult ‘Partu Datorem’ decided to experiment on themselves. The place seems a bit mysterious. This particular scene is the aftermath of the experiment. Was the experiment successful or a failure? The audience can find for themselves.
