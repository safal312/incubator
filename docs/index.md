# The Incubator

In ancient times, big bird-like creatures used to inhabit the planet Ova. A million years ago, a pandemic of sorts caused the extinction of the birds. That led to an imbalance in the planet’s ecosystem. However, in the following years, the parasite managed to infuse with the eggs of the birds. This led the eggs to gain consciousness. After many years, the eggs managed to establish a society and live harmoniously in it. 

However, there are some eggs who believe that the true nature of the world is to go back to where it started. They are on a mission to bring back the giant birds. After having people try to bring back the birds, the supreme court decided to make use of incubators and the formation of related cults illegal.

### Scene Description

This particular scene takes place inside a makeshift Incubator where a group of eggs from the cult ‘Partu Datorem’ decided to experiment on themselves. The place seems a bit mysterious. This particular scene is the aftermath of the experiment. 
We can see two eggs in the starting position, one of which is shaking on the floor. Meanwhile, looking around the room, we'll find an egg that is cracked already. Near the table we'll also find a chair fallen on the floor along with other items. This is a sign of disruption. On the table, there's a dead potted plant. There's a TV as well where the National Security Announcement is being played. Then, as we turn we'll find the name of the cult on the wall written in red: 'Partu Datorem'.
