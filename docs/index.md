# The Incubator

In ancient times, big bird-like creatures used to inhabit the planet Ova. A million years ago, a pandemic of sorts caused the extinction of the birds. That led to an imbalance in the planet’s ecosystem. However, in the following years, the parasite managed to infuse with the eggs of the birds. This led the eggs to gain consciousness. After many years, the eggs managed to establish a society and live harmoniously in it. 

However, there are some eggs who believe that the true nature of the world is to go back to where it started. They are on a mission to bring back the giant birds. After having people try to bring back the birds, the supreme court decided to make use of incubators and the formation of related cults illegal.

### Scene Description

This particular scene takes place inside a makeshift Incubator where a group of eggs from the cult ‘Partu Datorem’ decided to experiment on themselves. The place seems a bit mysterious. This particular scene is the aftermath of the experiment. 
We can see two eggs in the starting position, one of which is shaking on the floor. Meanwhile, looking around the room, we'll find an egg that is cracked already. Near the table we'll also find a chair fallen on the floor along with other items. This is a sign of disruption. On the table, there's a dead potted plant. There's a TV as well where the National Security Announcement is being played. Then, as we turn we'll find the name of the cult on the wall written in red: 'Partu Datorem'.

### Reflection

##### Moodboard

##### Initial sketches

![](images/space.jpg)
For this project, I first started with a rough sketch. I was going for a makeshift look to give off the feeling that the place was illegal. With the cracked egg and the red lighting, the scene is out of a post-apocalyptic world.

Using the VR storyboard template, I set up the elements around the perspective of the user. Having this and the moodboard made it easier when I started making the scene in Unity. 
Along the way, I decided to change a few aspects of the scene because of technical issues as well. I couldn't use the polybrush tool properly in order to apply the texture into the walls of the room and floor. Therefore, I decided to make the room a bit darker to stay within the theme and work around this deficiency. Next time, I'll look more into making walls properly with probuilder so that it is compatible with polybrush.

##### Playtesting
The project lives in the Unity editor. It hasn't been setup for Oculus yet, so the best way to experience this would be to play the scene and pan around the area using computer inputs. There is spatial audio in the room, so headphones would be the best way to experience the scene.

### Conclusion

Other than a couple of hiccups, the rest of the process went smoothly. This assignment made me more comfortable with using Unity, and this is going to make my workflow for future assignments much better.
